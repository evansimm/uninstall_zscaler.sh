# uninstall_zscaler.sh
 This was built using the instructions at https://help.zscaler.com/client-connector/uninstalling-zscaler-client-connector and is intended for macOS only. The script will need to be uploaded to Jamf Pro and automatically uninstall Zscaler. You will need to set the logout password for zscaler in Parameter 4 in a Jamf Pro policy in order for this to actually work.
